# Oshi Recognizer

Oshi(推し) is a Japanese word that refers to a person or character that you
support or like.  
We can build a model by collecting the images of Oshi and running machine
learning on them. We will need to prepare an image with the face extracted,
so we will put the tool in place.

I am using Twitter's API to automatically collect images of Oshi.

## How to use
